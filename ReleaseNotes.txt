Required APIS:
SDL2
SDL2_image
SDL2_tty.
SDL2_mixer

Please note required fix for SDL 2 - 
To fix the "winapifamily.h" issue, replace the SDL_platform.h header file with the one in the patch directory.
IE: SDL2\i686-w64-mingw32\include\SDL2

In Codeblocks: 
Linker Options:
-lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image -lSDL2_ttf -lSDL2_mixer
Beware of order:  It's important!

Search directories:
Compiler: SDL2\i686-w64-mingw32\include\SDL2
Linker: SDL2\i686-w64-mingw32\lib

You'll want to copy the i686 directories from SDL2_image and SDL2_tty to the SDL2 directory.

Adjust the project so the executable is generated in the root directory.

-jtb: What did you guys do, it's not compiling for me anymore!  I added the sdl2_mixer.  It's complaining about all the animation stuff.
